# Auto-desktop-wallpaper
#Author : Al Muntasir Abir

The app bascically changes desktop wallpaper automatically.
Whenever the app is run it sends a request to pixabay using its api to return link of it's free pictures.
it randomly selects one picture saves it locally and sets it as desktop wallpaper.
 you can change the search term/terms in the request.
Just wanted to do somthing like that.

*currently works only on windows 64 bit
